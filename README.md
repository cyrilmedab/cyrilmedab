- 👋 Hi, I’m @cyrilmedab
- 👀 I’m interested in ... switching from my wet lab, bench role into a career in the tech industry, building applications that impact people's lives!
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python and C# for Unity. My goal is eventually to combine my bioengineering background with my passion for XR and 
- the software engineering field; I hope I can contribute to developing bionformatic applications to streamline drug development or to XR medical devices, 
- like an updated Da Vinci!
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any coding project, especially in Unity! I'm relatively new and looking to learn and fully immerse myself.
- 
- 📫 How to reach me ... You can email me at cyrildmed@gmail.com. Looking forward to connect with anyone that's interested!
